## COBS Decoder (Hex Text File → Decoded Payload)

### What this project does

This program reads a normal `.txt` file containing **COBS-encoded bytes written in hex** and **prints the decoded payload bytes** (also in hex).
Frames are separated using the delimiter byte **`00`**.

### Input file format (`encoded.txt`)

* The file contains **hex bytes as text**, e.g.:

  * `03112203334400`
  * or with spaces/newlines: `03 11 22 03 33 44 00`
* Whitespace is optional (spaces/newlines/tabs can exist).
* Each frame ends with delimiter **`00`**.

Example (4 frames):
`03 11 22 03 33 44 00 01 03 55 66 00 04 AA BB CC 00 02 10 01 02 20 01 00`

### Output

* The decoder prints decoded payload bytes in hex.
* It also prints inserted `00` bytes where COBS restores zeros inside the payload.
* (If your current code prints only to console, you can redirect output to a file.)

### Build (GCC)

Compile with GCC in terminal:

* Use flags like `-Wall -Wextra` to catch warnings.

### Run

* Put your encoded stream in `encoded.txt`
* Run the program
* Check console output (or redirect output to a file)

### Notes / Common pitfalls

* `fgetc()` reads **ASCII characters** from the text file, so the program must convert **two hex characters → one byte** before decoding.
* Handle:

  * whitespace between hex digits/bytes
  * lowercase `a-f` and uppercase `A-F`
  * end-of-file safely (don’t try to read half a byte)
* COBS rule reminder:

  * Read **code**
  * Copy **(code−1)** bytes
  * Insert `00` only if **frame continues** and `code != 0xFF`

### Quick verification example

Encoded frame: `03 11 22 03 33 44 00`
Decoded payload should be: `11 22 00 33 44`
